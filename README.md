# StressPrediction
#### This is a model repository that contains Python and C++ code for
- Acquiring data from Aurdino Nano BLE33 and sending it over Bluetooth to Raspberry Pi - [arduino_code.ino]
- Preprocessing the data
- Extracting features from the processed data
- Parsing the data along the extracted features into the model for predictions
- Whole code runs on the Raspberry Pi Operating System (Raspberry Pi 4 - Model-B) - [model.py]
